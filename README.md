# Blog PWA
_Create a PWA for your blog without any changes to WordPress_

![pwa](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3104648/28351989-7f68389e-6c4b-11e7-9bf2-e9fcd4977e7a.png)

This is a very basic scheme that everybody, without any knowledge can use to implement its own Progressive Web App.

## How to use
1. You need a WordPress blog. Other CMS can work with this PWA with some changes, them must expose WordPress-like REST APIs.
2. Populate your blog with some posts. Divide posts into categories, since tags are not yet supported.
3. [Download](https://github.com/daquinoaldo/blog-wpa/archive/master.zip) this repository and upload the entire content of the zip on an Apache server.  
   Your blog's server is fine, but pay attention to the WordPress url scheme. I suggest you a subdomain.
4. Edit the `API_URL` in [js/app.js](js/app.js) to mach your blog domain.

### Additional requirements
PWA works only on https connections. Furthermore, http2 is strongly suggested.
- You can ask your hosting provider (noobie way).
- You can obtain for free using [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) (easy for most users).

### Testing on localhost
To test on your own PC you can use [https-localhost](https://github.com/daquinoaldo/https-localhost) (suggested, requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)) or [sserve](https://github.com/daquinoaldo/sserve).
